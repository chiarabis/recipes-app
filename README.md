### Notes
I got data from _Spoonacular API_. To get the API key you need to register. Since I use the free plan there is a daily quota of calls, after that the API will respond with the error code 402 and no more calls can be made until the quota resets. In your code, you have to change the part of API Key with your own one, once you log in. Please, read the documentation on [the spoonacular website](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
