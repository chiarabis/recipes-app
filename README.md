### Notes
I have used Spoonacular API to get data. In the API request you have to change the part of API Key with your own one once you log in.
```fetch('https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/random?apiKey=328dabcd7af647cca3432a1aa982eccf&number=9')```: you have to sobstitute this part ```apiKey=328dabcd7af647cca3432a1aa982eccf```.
